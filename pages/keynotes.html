                                    <p>The purpose of science and technology development around the world is shifting to human well-being. The grand challenges facing human society in the twenty-first century, such as protecting human health and promoting human well-being, cannot be solved by one discipline alone. Comprehensive use of convergence knowledge, the merging of insights obtained through convergent research from widely diverse fields, can be expected to address these challenges. Convergence is a process that stimulates innovation and discovery and leads to the creation of new problem-driven solutions by multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>
